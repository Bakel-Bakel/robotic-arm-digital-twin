# ðŸ¤–Robotic Arm Digital Twin â€“ Unity + MATLAB Integration

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project aims to create a **virtual robotic arm** in Unity, simulate its motion using kinematics, and control it using MATLAB via real-time communication. The pipeline integrates 3D modeling (SolidWorks â†’ Blender â†’ Unity), DH parameter setup, MATLAB Robotics Toolbox, and Unity scripting with C#.

The final objective is to implement an **interactive, intelligent robotic system** that can:
- Pick and place objects
- Sort by color using vision from Unity to MATLAB
- Operate on a conveyor belt system with sensors and feedback

## ðŸŽ¯ What Iâ€™m Learning

- Importing and configuring robotic models in Unity
- Defining revolute joints and reference origins in Blender
- Building and testing kinematic chains using the Denavitâ€“Hartenberg (DH) convention
- Real-time robotic arm control using MATLAB scripts
- C# and MATLAB communication (image transfer, data sync)
- Conveyor belt simulation with sensor-triggered responses
